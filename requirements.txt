# requirements.txt and the 'install_requires' section of setup.py look similar, but they aim at slightly different goals.
#
# - setup.py contains the list of dependencies for the _execution_ of of the project.
#   This means that ancillary packages, like those related to sphinx, should not be included.
#   Also, included packages should report a fixed version, with whom the project has been tested.
#   setup.py is used when installing the project via `pip install ...`
#
# - requirements.txt contains the list of dependencies for the development.
#   For example, the requirements for the documentation (sphinx) belong to requirements.txt, while
#  they are not included in setup.py.
#  Also, packages in requirements.txt can be listed without any version. But it is a good practice to
#  always fix the version
